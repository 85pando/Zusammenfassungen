\section*{Formal Methods for Certification}
\subsection*{Certification of Avionic Systems}

        \item \emph{standard certificate} standard operations
        \item \emph{special airworthiness certificates} aircraft with special permissions, e.g. experimental aircraft
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{type certificate} TC: all airplanes of this family are ok
    \item \emph{issue of interpretation}: clarifications are issued\\
