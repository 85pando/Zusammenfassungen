\section*{Techniques for Safety Assessment}
\subsection*{Introduction}
\begin{description}
    \item[hazard:] condition that has potentially harmful consequences (for people or environment)
    \item[accident:] hazard, that results in harmful consequences
    \item[accidental event:] event, that leads up to an accident
    \item[incident, near accident, near miss:] an event, that could be an accident, but nothing bad happened
    \item[severity:] impact of possible hazard
    \item[risk:] severity and possibility
\end{description}

\subsection*{Hazard Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item collection of different techniques
    \begin{description}
        \item[inductive] start by considering the initiating causes of given hazard, trace them forward through event propagation to corresponding safety consequences \follows Failure Mode Effects Analysis
        \item[deductive] consider unintended behavior of system, trace it backward to corresponding causes \follows Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
    \end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item used in all fields of safety engineering
    \item deductive analytical technique
    \item \emph{top-level event} (TLE) is specified and the system is analyzed for possible chain of \emph{basic events}, that may cause the TLE
    \item analyze cause of hazard, not find hazards
    \item typical representation is a \emph{fault tree} (FT), makes use of logical gates (AND, OR)
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{images/FTsimple.png}
    \end{center}
    \newpage
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{images/FTsymbols.png}
    \columnbreak
    \begin{description}
        \item[AND] both events are required to occur
        \item[OR] alternate causes
        \item[inhibit, NOT] less common
        \item[basic events] leafs (depicted by a circle)
        \item[intermediate events] nodes between leafs and root (depicted by a square)
        \item[undeveloped event] not further analyzed, because not important (depicted by a diamond)
        \item an event needs to be developed considering \emph{immediate}, \emph{necessary} and \emph{sufficient} results
        \item[elementary faults] \follows basic events
        \item[transfer symbols] may link different parts of tree
        \item[inhibit gates, conditioning events] can be used to constrain the ways that faults are propagated inside FT
        \item[dynamic gates] like \emph{priority AND} \follows temporal constraints
    \end{description}
    \end{multicols}
    \item fault tree can be shown as tree, formula or truth table\\ tree is most readable
    \item important notations:
    \begin{description}
        \item[scope \& boundary] define, which parts of the system will be included in the analysis \& under which hypothesis/ operational constraints the system will be analyzed
        \begin{description}
            \item[boundary] initial state of system, and assumptions about environment
        \end{description}
        \item[level of resolution] level of detail used to trace back an event (which must be traced farther down, which can be left undeveloped)
    \end{description}
    \item there may be different choices for intermediate events
    \item \emph{localized} fault \follows \emph{primary, secondary, command} faults are investigated
    \begin{description}
        \item[primary] fault is in an environment, the component is specified for
        \item[secondary] fault is in an environment, the component is not specified for
        \item[command] fault is due to correct operation, but at the wrong time
    \end{description}
    \item qualtitative analysis can be conducted after tree has been completed
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Minimal Cut Set} minimal set of events needed for the top event \follows top event, OR, all events needed
        \item shows up weaknesses of system
    \end{itemize}
    \item quantitative analysis can be conducted after tree has been completed
    \begin{itemize}
        \item use minimal cut set to calculate probability of the top event (from the probability of basic events)
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/FTex.png}
    \end{center}
    \item automatic FT synthesis possible if design is purely hardware
    \item software FTA
    \begin{itemize}
        \item verification \follows code already has to be written {\tiny (Or the logic has to be fully described)}
        \item if loops present in software \follows human assistance needed
    \end{itemize}
    \item quantitative analysis very costly \follows may be more feasible, if some designs and only small differences
    \item additional analysis needed for effective safety program
    \item suited for discrete events (valve open/ close) but not for rate- or time- dependent events
    \bad not suited for \emph{phased mission} (missions, where there are different phases) (one fault tree needed for each phase, as same components may be used in different configurations and environments)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item inductive technique
    \item introduced 1940 by US military, later for Apollo (NASA)
    \item extensive spread in variety of domains
    \item starts with identification of failure modes \follows forward reasoning \follows asses their effects on complete system
    \item usually consider effects on same level (and usually one level higher)
    \item also \emph{scope} and \emph{boundary} \follows by safety engineer and take user requirements into account
    \item can be applied to hardware component level or at functional level
    \item typically consider only single faults, combinations can be considered in particular cases
    \item extension: \emph{Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis} (FMECA)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item also take criticality of consequences of component failures into account
        \item can identify weaknesses in development process (e.g. assembly or manufacturing) \follows \emph{process FMECA}
    \end{itemize}
    \item results \follows FMEA-table
    \item results of FMEA \follows \emph{Failure Mode Effects Summary} (FMES) \follows failure modes leading so same effect are grouped
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{HAZard and OPerability studies (HAZOP)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item inductive method
    \item developed in chemical domain in 1960s
    \item used primarily in process industries (chemical, petrochemical, nuclear)
    \item team approach to hazard analysis, members have different backgrounds and competences
    \item investigate basic set of operations \follows consider deviations from normal operation \follows potentially hazardous effects
    \item
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Event Tree Analysis (ETA)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item bottom-up
    \item developed in nuclear industry in 1960s
    \item starts from an \emph{initiating event}, proceed from from left to right, branch on further events during analysis \follows determine potential effects
    \item typically binary branching
    \item can get quite large \follows prune illogical branches and branches, that cause nothing bad
    \item events can be quantified \follows assign probabilities for each branch
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Risk Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item combines \emph{measure of severity} of the consequences of a safety hazard and a \emph{measure of the likelihood} (probability/ frequency)
    \item always refers to undesired future consequences, expectation of loss (human live, economic, \dots)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Risk Measures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item qualitatively or quantitatively
    \begin{description}
        \item[quantitatively] risk is defined on probability measures (e.g. number of fatalities)
        \begin{description}
            \item[Individual Risk Per Annum] (IRPA) probability, that an individuum dies within a 1-year exposure to hazard
            \item[fatal accident rate] expected number of fatalities per $10^8$ hours of exposure
        \end{description}
        \item[qualitatively] depends on the kind of consequences (e.g. are they dead or just hurt)
    \end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Classification of Hazards: Severity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item degrees of severity (depends on standard used): \emph{catastrophic}, \emph{critical}, \emph{hazardous}, \emph{negligible}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Classification of Hazards: Frequency}
\begin{itemize}
    \item frequency of occurrence (depend on standard): \emph{frequent}, \emph{probable}, \emph{remote}
    \item different units, e.g. number of events per flight hour
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Classification of Risks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item combination of qualitative and quantitative measure
    \item[\follows] \emph{risk class} or \emph{risk level}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Risk Management and Acceptance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item reduce likelihood of potential accidents
    \item mitigate consequences of potential accidents
    \item different ways to achieve this
    \begin{itemize}
        \item eliminate potential hazards
        \item prevent occurrence of accidental events
        \item reduce effect of accidents
    \end{itemize}
    \item thus includes several techniques
    \begin{itemize}
        \item hazard identification
        \item hazard assessment
        \item risk evaluation
        \item risk reduction
    \end{itemize}
    \item produce safety argument, that risk management has been done (for safety critical systems) \follows certification authorities
    \item definition of \emph{acceptable risk} is a decision to be taken \follows cost/ benefit analysis
    \begin{description}
        \item[As Low As Reasonable Practicable] the cost of further risk reduction is disproportionate with the reduction gained
    \end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Safety Integrity Levels}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \follows the likelihood that a system will perform all its safety critical functions in a satisfactory way with respect to given operational conditions and period of time
    \item can be further classified into
    \begin{itemize}
        \item hardware integrity
        \item systematic integrity
        \item software integrity
    \end{itemize}
    \item safety integrity level is orthogonal to risk classification
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{CheckLists}
\begin{itemize}
    \item make a repository of mistakes (e.g. in company), pass down information already learned
    \item lists of hazards or specific design features
    \item used in all life-cycle phases
    \good list known hazards, so that none are overlooked
    \good ensure consistent procedures (e.g. preflight checklist)
    \bad may be relied on to much
    \bad may become very big
    \bad induce false confidence (if everything is checked, it surely will be ok, won't it \dots)

        \item extension: \emph{Mond Index} includes also toxic material
    \end{itemize}
    \item quantitative indication of potential for hazards associated with design
    \item not very good for unique design or design, where components develop very quickly
