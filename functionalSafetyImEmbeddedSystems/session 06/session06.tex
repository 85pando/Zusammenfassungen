\section*{Introduction}
\subsection*{Complex Safety-Critical Systems}
\begin{shaded}
    A \emph{complex safety-critical system} is a system, whose safety cannot be shown solely be test, whose logic is difficult to comprehend without the aid of analytical tools, and that might directly or indirectly contribute to put human lives at risk, damage the environment, or cause big economical losses.
\end{shaded}
\begin{itemize}
    \item higher performance and lower price gained through increasing complexity \follows software size is growing exponentially
    \item reasons for complexity:
    \begin{description}
        \item[number of functions]
        \item[number of states]
        \item[discrete behavior] discrete systems with discontinuous behavior \follows small input deviation may cause large output deviations
        \item[invisibility] at least 5 of 9 diagram types must be used to properly model systems architecture
    \end{description}
    \item different levels of critical systems
    \begin{description}
        \item[buisnes-critical] high economical loss
        \item[mission-critical] failures will lead to mission not possible
        \item[safety-critical] risk to human life
    \end{description}
    \item what to do on failures
    \begin{description}
        \item[fail-operational] required to operate also in degraded conditions (some parts of the system not working)
        \item[fail-safe] safely shut-down in case of single or multiple failures
    \end{description}
    \item reasons for systems to fail
    \begin{description}
        \item[inherently incapable design] errors during development lead to inadequate system
        \item[overstressed system] operation in conditions, for which system was not designed
        \item[variation in the production and design] variations in materials, production processes, quality assurance, \dots
        \item[wear-out, time-related phenomena] components become weaker with use and age \follows probability of failure increases over time
        \item[errors] just errors
    \end{description}
    \item consider safety and failure in design phase \follows degraded environment requirements
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Dealing with Failures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item in the past: ``fix-fly-fix''
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Role of Formal Methods}

    \begin{description}
        \item[at most, one component fails] obvious for majority voting, but also for the other
        \item[the voting mechanism does not fail] voting is not replicated, single point of failure
        \item[no systemic failures] the different instances fail independently
        \item[Isolation of failed component is not an issue] i.e. masking a faulty output is sufficient to guarantee that the system will operate as expected
    \end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Dealing with Multiple Failures}

    \item Mean Time Between Failures $MTBF=MTTF+MTTR$
    \item $availability=\frac{MTTF}{MTTF+MTTR} = \frac{MTTF}{MTTB}$
\end{itemize}
