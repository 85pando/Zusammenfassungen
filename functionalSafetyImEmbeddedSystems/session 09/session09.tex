\section*{Formal Methods for Safety Assessment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item formal method \follows use of formalisms and techniques (based on mathematics) for specification, design, analysis
    \item formalized methods: several notations, different sorts of diagrams, pseudocode, formality, but no formal foundation
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Advantages of Formal Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item growing complexity of computer-based system
    \item remove ambiguities in specification of requirements and models
    \item \emph{verification} checking, whether a system correctly implements requirements
    \item \emph{validation} check, whether the started requirements are the intended ones
    \item traditional techniques: testing, simulation (not exhaustive)
    \item formal methods: exhaustive, automation possible
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Formal Methods in the Development Process}
\begin{itemize}
    \item formal methods can have high level ob abstraction
    \item Rushby's four different levels:
    \begin{description}
        \item[Level 0] \emph{no use of formal methods} standard practice
        \item[Level 1] \emph{use of concepts and notation from discrete mathematics} concepts and notations from discrete mathematics and mathematical logic
        \item[Level 2] \emph{use of formalized specification languages with some mechanized support tools} formal notations with fixed syntax, at least limited tool support, proof performed manually
        \item[Level 3] \emph{Use of fully formal specification languages with comprehensive support environments, including mechanized theorem proving or proof checking} fully formal specification languages, supported by tools, automatic generation of proofs, proofs are fully formalized
    \end{description}
    \item lower levels of rigor: not so safety relevant
    \item high levels of rigor \follows fully safety critical systems
    \item formal methods need not be applied everywhere \follows overall correctness not guaranteed
    \item apply formal methods early or late?
    \begin{description}
        \item[early] specification bugs are the worst, work better at early stages than testing and simulation (which work good at code/ gate level)
        \item[late] completed system will be verified
    \end{description}
    \item limit formal methods to certain subsystems
    \item formal methods can be used for \emph{certification} of safety-critical systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Problems and Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \bad formal methods are expensive
    \good formal methods can find bugs in very early stages \follows save money in long run
    \bad difficult to use, requires expertise
    \bad maximum benefits only, if applied in every stage of development process
    \good use lightweight formal methods (produce specifications of system, although no full coverage)
    \bad single formalism not suited for whole process, use different formalisms \follows may cause problems when verification has to be assembled
    \bad not fully automatic, problems often huge, computing power not enough
    \bad formal languages are often hard to understand
    \bad proof (by theorem prover/model checker may not be enough to convince certification authority)
    \good counterexamples
    \bad verifier may produce wrong results
\end{itemize}
