\begin{itemize}
    \item only fault tolerance depends on technical solution, the others depend on development process
    \item development process helps improve efficiency, efficacy and is needed for certification
    \item Higher level of criticality \follows more formality
    \item domain specific standards/ processes
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What makes a system complex?}
essential complexity (Dvorak (2009))
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Functions to be performed:} wide range of different functions, tasks regulated by complex physical or control laws, implement complex control logic
    \item \emph{Operating Environment:} harsh environment, tight timing constraints, input from different sensors, output to different actuators

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Determine scope of analysis (the risk to analyze)
            \item Define the models regulating the risk
            \item Define the effects of the risk base on the model
            \item Determine the failures on the systems components (based on effects of risk)
            \item Determine how the failures propagate to the rest of the system

            \item \emph{conformity inspection}: provide documentation of compliance with design,
            \item tests, inspections, analyses
        \end{itemize}
        \item post-certification phase
        \begin{itemize}
            \item define stuff for managing and maintaining certification through life-cycle
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \emph{issues book} properly trace and deal with issues\\
    compliance can be shown by
    \begin{description}
        \item[standard techniques]  issue is shown to be properly handled via safety analysis technique
        \item[equivalent level of safety] compensating factors are put in place
        \item[special condition] adoption of unusual design feature or technique does not allow standard practices
    \end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Project Management Workflow}
\begin{shaded}
    ``The application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.''
\end{shaded}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{PRoject IN a Controlled Environment} (PRINCE2) (British)
    \item \emph{Project Management BOdy of Knowledge} (PMBOK) (American)
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/management.png}
    \end{center}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Safety Process Definition and Tailoring}
\begin{itemize}
    \item customize development process, adapt it to level of formality required
    \item output is a document that describes (minimum):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item how safety program will be implemented, techniques and standards
        \item resources responsible for implementation of safety plan (\follows dedicated safety team)
        \item how safety program and safety team fit into overall project structure, lines of communication
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Safety Program Implementation and Monitoring}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ensure that safety program is implemented according to standards and rules defined for project
    \item safety manager responsible for
    \begin{itemize}
        \item maintain log of identified hazards and residual hazards
        \item formally approving any residual hazard
        \item communicate hazards and residual hazards to end user
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Other Management Activities}
\begin{description}
    \item[planning] forecasting the dimensions of project
    \item[task activation] project manager activates and verifies termination of tasks according to plan
    \item[monitoring and control] data about progress is collected and compared with baseline plans
    \item[communication] project manager is responsible for information flow
    \item[configuration management] provide visibility and control over changes
    \item[closing] asses project after end
\end{description}

\subsection*{Tool Support}

\subsubsection*{Supporting the Development Workflow}
\begin{description}
    \item[requirement management tools]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item annotate enrich requirements with meta-information
        \item maintain traceability
    \end{itemize}
    \item[requirement analysis tool] reason about requirements, provide information about consistency/ completeness, often with formal representations
    \item[modeling tools, simulators, code generators] blur distinction between design, development and testing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item simulation: SPICE, MATLAB Simulink
        \item formal verification: SPIN; NuSMV, theorem provers
    \end{itemize}
    \item[static analysis tools] IDEs, certified compilers
    \item[versioning systems] coherent management of whole sets of files
    \item[build and continuous integration] simplify management of complex software systems
    \item[configuration management]
    \item[issue and bug-tracking management]
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Supporting the Testing Workflow}
\begin{itemize}
    \item tools, that help maintain specification of tests, often web based, trace test results, integration with bug-tracking tools
    \item tools to support automatic generation and execution of tests, based on model checkers and static analysis, automatic generation of test cases
    \item tools to support evaluation of tests, verify completeness of tests, code coverage
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Supporting the Safety Analysis Workflow}
\begin{itemize}
    \item tools for management of safety-related information, FaulTree+, semantically meaningful way of drawing and managing fault trees
    \item tools for quantitative assessment of risks and hazards, based on probability theory, monte carlo simulation, markov analysis
    \item tools for qualitative assessment of risks and hazards, tools like NuSMV-SA, automatic generation of fault trees (?)
\end{itemize}
