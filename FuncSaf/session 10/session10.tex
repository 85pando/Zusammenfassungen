\section*{Formal Methods for Safety Assessment (ctd)}
\subsubsection*{Model Checking}
\begin{itemize}
    \item complement simulation and testing
    \item system is modeled as state transition system
    \item check automatically, that specifications are met (exhaustively explore state space)
    \item finite models \follows guaranteed termination
    \item counterexample is produced, when failure state is found
    \item check a \emph{Kripke}-structure \follows may be exponential in number of components
    \item \emph{explicit model checking} SPIN: explicitly compute states
    \item \emph{symbolic model checking} SMV, NuSMV, VIS\follows manipulate sets of states and transitions
    \item \emph{binary decision diagrams} SMV: representation for logic formulae
    \item \emph{bounded model checking} (symbolic) bound steps to a value $k$, uses modern SAT solvers
    \item often run bdd and bmc in parallel, the first one to finishes, wins
    \item \emph{timed model checking} UPAAL, KRONOS
    \item \emph{probabilistic model checking} PRISM, MRMC
    \item \emph{partial order reduction} \follows reduce state space
    \item \emph{symmetry reduction} exploit symmetry in model
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Using Model Checking for Requirements Validation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item validate a set of requirements (assumes, that requirements meet end-user expectations)
    \item RAT tool provides way to asses quality of requirements
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{property simulation} \follows behavior associated with each requirement
        \item \emph{property assurance} check for logical consistency (=freedom from contradictions)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item if requirements are logically inconsistent \follows find subset, that is explanation for inconsistency
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Using Model Checking for Property Verification}
\begin{itemize}
    \item build formal model for system (state transition system)
    \item checked by model checker
    \item FSAP tool for formal verification and safety analysis, GUI on top of NuSMV
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Formal Safety Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ESACS and ISAAC \follows ESACS methodology supported by formal methods, to assist system development and safety analysis
    \item shared formal notations between design and safety analysis
    \item decoupling between nominal model and fault model
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item formal model (design or safety engineer) \follows \emph{nominal system model} (only nominal behavior)
        \item \emph{fault injection}: put nominal model into failure modes \follows extended model through model extension
    \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Fault Injection}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/faultinjection.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Fault Models and Model Extension}
\begin{itemize}
    \item FSAP generic failure mode library: library of typical failure modes to be injected
    \item model extension takes specification of fault to be added
    \item \emph{fault configuration} subset of failure mode variables
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Fault Tree Generation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item fault tree can be represented as collection: of minimal cut sets TLE and and conjunction of corresponding basic faults
    \item generation of fault tree:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item need to remember, if fault has been activated during iterative traversal
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{images/faultTreeGeneration.png}
        \end{center}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{FMEA Table Generation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item input: set of failure modes + set of events to be analyzed
    \item FSAP does this somehow (magic?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Industrial Application of Formal Methods}
\subsubsection*{IBMs Customer Information Control System}
\begin{itemize}
    \item more than $750\;000$ lines of code
    \item more than $2\;000$ pages of formal specifications produced
    \item reduction in development cost of about $9\%$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item formal methods in design and development become more pervasive
    \item CounterExample Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) builds set of abstraction from set of predicates
    \item nontrivial: systems with both digital and analogue parts (\emph{hybrid systems})
\end{itemize}
