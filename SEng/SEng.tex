\section{Software Crisis}
Term from NATO study group in 1967.
\begin{description}
	\item[fault] mistake/error made by a human during a software activity (erroneous design, requirements, coding)
	\item[failure] observed departure of a system from the desired state
\end{description}
\subsection{symptoms}
\begin{itemize}
	\item products are delivered late \follows high cost
	\item projects exceed budgeds \follows high cost \follows waste of resources
	\item product doesn't do, whats its supposed to do \follows inefficient \follows hight cost
	\item products are defective \follows high cost (failures, maintenance,\dots), ethical considerations
	\item projects get abandonded before delivery \follows waste of resources
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Characteristics of software}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Software is \emph{engineered}, not manufactured (custom built, little to no (mechanical) assembly, human intensive process)
	\item Software does not wear out (but: change of requirements, changes in environment)
	\item software is \emph{complex}
	\item software is \emph{detemining system factor} (up to 80\% of development effort)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why is software difficult to produce?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item no similiar system built so far (problems unknown, assumptions about environment may be wrong)
	\item \emph{Requirements} are not well understood/phrased
	\item Requirements \emph{change} during development
	\item complex \emph{interaction}
	\item nature of systems:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item concurrent systems (races, deadlocks, \dots)
			\item embedded systems (hardware interaction, timing, \dots)
			\item information systems (complexity, legacy, \dots)
		\end{itemize}
	\item software is \emph{easily changeble} \follows ``code and fix''
	\item software is \emph{discreet} (either fails, or doesn't)\marginnote{Stimmt auch nicht immer\dots}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Debvelopment Myths}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Management
		\begin{itemize}
			\item standard books, software, tools, \dots \follows software hard to standardize
			\item behind schedule? add programmers! \follows effort to integrate new people
		\end{itemize}
	\item Customer
		\begin{itemize}
			\item general statement of objectives sufficient
			\item change (as in requirements) can easily be implemented
		\end{itemize}
	\item Practioner
		\begin{itemize}
			\item once programm is running, job is done
			\item until programm is running, no way to check quality
			\item only deliverable is working programm
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Engineering}
Communication between a huge number of parties (customer, end user, sw designer, developer, \dots) must be maintained. \\
Highly complex systems: SE has to provide solutions.

\begin{description}
	\item[\follows] base sw production on engineering approach
	\item[\follows] design sw as a \emph{process} that supports
		\begin{itemize}
			\item correctness \& dependability
			\item cost-effectivenes
			\item complexity of project
			\item longevity of product, life cycle, changes
			\item communication amongst parties
		\end{itemize}
	\item[\follows] software engineering process model
\end{description}

\section{waterfall model}
\input{images/waterfall.tex}

\begin{description}
	\item[System Design] problem \& System requirements, fesability study, define main subsystems (allocate to hw/sw), system design document (\textsc{Sdd}, informal, with customer, somtimes: user manuals, user interfaces, test plans)
	\item[Requirements] requirement analysis (``what'' the system has to do (not how), software requirements describing observable external behaviour (functional, nonfunctional)), software requirement specification (\textsc{Srs})
	\item[Design] ``how'' the system is working, architectural (high level) design (decompose problem into components, global data structures, internal interfaces), detailed design (algorithmic design, internal data structures, programming language(s))
	\item[Implementation] (and Testing) \follows translate design modules into code, test modules in isolation
	\item[Integration] (and Testing) integrate tested modules to form system, \emph{integration testing}, validation, customer accptance tests
	\item[maintenance] deploy product, perform maintenance (corrective, adaptive, perfective), retire product
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Definition of seperate Tasks (Seperation of concerns)\\dividing complex design problems into smaller units \follows facilitates team work/reproducibility
	\item specification and documentation  \follows enforces documentation, facilitates testing (against requirements specification)
	\item further concepts
		\begin{itemize}
			\item verification / validation (compare intermediate results with requirements and design)
			\item prototyping (mock-up available early, reduces risk)
			\item evolutionary process model (accommodate change)
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Defects}
\begin{itemize}
	\item no feedback loops
	\item document driven, inflexible
	\item large time gap between inception and completion
\end{itemize}

	\item[Maintainability:] software is easy to maintain/extend
	\item[Performance:] system is usable (e.g. input response)
	\item[Reusability:] re-use of previously used, tested and verified code
	\item[Interoperability:] standardisation, interfaces, \dots
\end{description}

	\item[Generality:] focus on the discovery of more general problems
\end{description}

\section{Requiremnt \& Analysis}

\subsection{Requirement Elicitation}
\begin{shaded}
``A \textbf{requirement} is a condition or capability that must be met or professed by a system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally inposed document.'' \\
(ANSI/IEEE Standard 729-1983)
\end{shaded}
requirements \follows description of the \emph{externally visible (interface) \marginnote{not environment behaviour}behaviour}, the ``what''\\
Interaction between the system and the system-relevant portion of the envrionment

\begin{description}
	\item[User (Client) requirements:] statements in natural language plus diagramms
	\item[System requirements:] structured document, detailed description of system's functions, services and operational constraints; may be part of contract between client and contractor
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Types of requirements}
\begin{description}
	\item[functional requirements:] high-level-``what'' the system should do
		\begin{itemize}
			\item statement which services the system should provide
			\item interaction between system and environment (system states, i/o)
			\item how the system should behave in particular situations
			\item describe the system services in detail
			\item often included with ``shall/should''
		\end{itemize}
	\item[nonfunctional requirements:] (if not met, system may be useless (not usable)) \\
	nonfunctional requirements often have quantitative measures (MB, training time, availability, \dots)\\
	\input{images/nonfunctional_req.tex}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item not primarly related to sytem's funcions/services, but to quality and additinal (quantitative) characteristics
			\item constraints on the services/functions:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item reliability (avalability, integrity, security, safety)
				\item accuracy of results
				\item performance / timing
				\item human-computer interface issues
				\item operating and physical constraints
				\item portability and interoperatbility
				\item reliability
				\item response time
				\item storage requirements
				\item standards \dots
				\item also: particular system, programming language or development method
			\end{itemize}
			\item product requirements (product must behave in particular way (execution time, speed, reliability, \dots))
			\item organisational requirements (standards used, impelementation requirements, \dots)
			\item external requirements (interoperatbility/legislative requirements, \dots)
		\end{itemize}
		\item[domain requirements:] (if not met, system may be unworkable in that domain)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item derived from application domain
				\item characteristics/features of domain
				\item constraints on existing requirements
				\item define specific computations
				\item may be expressed in domain specific language \follows often hard to understand
				\item often implicit \follows hard to aquire
			\end{itemize}
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Requirement Specification Properties}
\begin{description}
	\item[correctness:] facts in requirement specification \follows required properties of the system
	\item[unambiguity:] all specifications have a single interpretation
	\item[completeness:] \ \\
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item every property required of the system is expressed in the specification\\
			{\small does this include things that are \emph{not permitted?}}
			\item the responses of the software system on all types of possible input values are specified
			\item \dots {\small (more possible)}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item[verifiability:] there exists an effective (manual/automatic) process for checking wether a software product satisfies the required properties (formal verification (mathematical proof) or validation (model checking, testing, simulation)), often not possible for every requirement
	\item[consistency:] no two requirements contradict each other: never $A \wedge \neg A$
	\item[traced:] origin of every requirement is clear
	\item[traceable:] requirement specification is edited so it is easy to reference every single requirement (e.g. numbering)
	\item[design independent:] the requirement specification does not require specific software/architecture/algorithms
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Activities during the requirement Stage}
	\begin{description}
		\item[starting point] \ \\
			\begin{itemize}
				\item customer requirements (abstract)
				\item system specification document (hw \& sw)
			\end{itemize}
		\item[Activities (Kotonya+Sommerville)] \ \\
			\begin{itemize}
				\item requirement elicitation\marginnote{Elicitation \follows Herausholen} (interviews, scenarios, market observation, \dots) \\
				determine, which of possibly contradictory requirements are important
				\item requirement documentation and specification (comprehensible requirements document)
				\item requirement validation (consistency, completeness, correspondence of documented requirements and abstract customer or user requirements)
			\end{itemize}
			\input{images/requirementProc.tex}
			\item[social activity:]
			Not a single person knows everything about the system \follows communication is needed \follows difficult (technical language, ambiguities, customers not aware of needs, personalities.)
	\end{description}

\subsubsection{Interviewing / Structured Questioning Techniques}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item context-of-system (why are we building this system/who are the users/critical functionality/needs)
	\item open-ended questions (produce large amount of info/use, when not much known yet
	\item close-ended questions (specific questions))
	\item rephrase questions (make sure answers understood right/inconsistencies/ambiguities)
	\item whom else to interview
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Learning from Existing Systems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item analyse user manuals
	\item use/play with existing systems
	\item market analysis (competing systems, market research, which features to be included)
	\item reverse engineering
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{requirement uncertainty}
When the customer does not know, what he really needs/wants \follows prototype.
Built prototype early (only if prototype build is faster than system build),
use prototype for requirement elicitation.
Prototyping also part of some life cycle and process models (spiral model)

\subsubsection{Requirements Gathering - Brainstorming}

	\end{itemize}
	\item Session phase

		\item orientation (welcome, overview)
		\item define high-level requirements (objectives, benefits, strategic/future considerations, constraints and assumptions, security/audit/control) \follows recorded by analyst, discussion (refine, assess requirements)

	\end{itemize}
	\item Wrap-Up Phase
	\begin{itemize}
		\item transform session documents into formal planning documents (analyst)

\section{Design}

\subsection{Design Objectives}
What \follows How \\
Manage Complexity \\
Design for Change (anticipate change at all stages, reduce cost of changes)

\begin{itemize}
	\item design process should not suffer from ``tunnel vision''
	\item design should be traceable to analysis model
	\item don't reinvent the wheel
	\item minimize intelectual distance between software and real-world problem
	\item uniformity and integration
	\item acommodate change
	\item degrade gently, when aberrant data/events/\dots encountered
	\item Design is not coding
	\item assess design for quality while it is created
	\item review design
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Classical and Object-Oriented Design}
\subsubsection{Procedural Design}
\begin{itemize}
	\item decomposition of system into modules
	\item describe module interactions
	\item structure of procedure definitions/invokations
	\item no abstract data types/inheritance
\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
	\item[Architectural Design:] determine major elemts (modules) and relationships
	\item[Interface Design:] how to design interrelation/communiccation/mutural reliance (contracts) of modules
	\item[Data Design:] data structures
	\item[Procedural Design:] determine procedural description for elements
\end{description}

\paragraph{Module}
\begin{itemize}
	\item well defined component of system (provides set of services to other modules, consists of (name, interface, body), information hiding)
	\item master complexity, facilitate documentation, enable teamwork
	\item interface descrition (``contract server/client'') languages (CORBA IDL, Eiffel)
	\item \emph{Cohesion} (intra module bindings, ``degree to which a module performs one and only one function'')
	\item \emph{coupling} (inter module bindings, ``degree to which a module is connected to other modules'' (direct access, data transfer, \dots))
	\item desired: high cohesion, low coupling
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Object-Oriented Design}
\begin{itemize}
	\item model system als collection of classes + objects
	\item description of object interfaces
	\item encapsulation, abstract data types
	\item reuse through inheritance
	\item polymorphism
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Activities}
\begin{itemize}
	\item partition model into subsystems
	\item identify concurrency
	\item allocate subsystems to processor tasks
	\item develop ui design
	\item choose strategy for data management
	\item identify global resources (and control mechaninsm, task management)
	\item consider boundary conditions (and how to be handled)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sonderfälle (Systemstart, Initialisierung, Herunterfahren, Schwere Fehler und Ausnahmen, beschädigte Daten, Netzwerkfehler, \dots)
		\item \follows \textbf{Boundary Use Case} (für alle Subsysteme und Dauerhafte Objekte: Konfiguration, Start/Herunterfahren, Fehlerbehandlung)
		\item Für Komponentenfehlertyp (Netzerkausfall, \dots) wird entschieden, wie System reagieren soll \follows Anlegen eines \textbf{Exceptional Use Case}
	\end{itemize}
	\item review, consider trade-offs
\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
	\item[Booch Method:] macro development process (architectural planning, patritioning, layering) + micrp development process (rules for implementing specifics)
	\item[Rumbaugh Method:] system design (analysis models represent system, layout of components, partitioning into subsystems, taking exec environment into account) + object design (design of algos/data structures)
	\item[Jacboson Method:] traceability from analysis model, adaptrion of analysis model to real-world env, primary design objects categorized (interface, entity, control), determine communication \follows organize into subsystems
	\item[Wirfs-Brock Method:] analysis \follows design, def of protocols through inter-object contracts, specification of classes and subsystems
\end{description}
\begin{itemize}
	\item maintenance (objects work standalone), reuse (objects can be used again), reduce semantic gaps (real-world $\leftrightarrow$ software)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Generalisation \& Inheritance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item objects are members of classes (define attributes, operations)
	\item class hirarchy \follows Generalisation
	\item generalistaion in UML \follows inheritance in OO
	\item abstraction \follows classify entities
	\item inheritance graph \follows organistational knowledge about domain/system
	\item \emph{Cohesion} how well fits the functionality of a class together
	\item \emph{Coupling} B subclass of A \follows B inherits from A \follows coupling between A/B, reflects real-world structure (not design decision)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design with the UML}
\subsubsection{types of models}
\begin{description}
	\item[design models:] show objects, object classes, relationships
	\item[static models:] describe static structure, object classes and relationships
	\item[dynamic models:] describe dynamic interactions between objects
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Typically used models}
\begin{description}
	\item[subsystem/component diagrams:] structural refinement of objects \\
	A \textbf{UML component} ``represents a modular part of a system, that encapsulates its content and whose manifestation is replaceable within its environment. A component defines its behavior in terms of provided and required interfaces
'' \follows subsystem \\
	\input{images/component-diagram}
	\item[sequence diagrams:] model order of interactions among objects\\
	\input{images/sequence-diagram}
	\item[statechart diagrams:] model state behaviour of \underline{one} object, show how objects respond to and state transitions triggered by service requests, concurrency possible (seperate by dashed line) \\
	\input{images/state-diagram}
	\item[acitivity diagram:] model concurrent behabiour of object
	\item [Deployment Diagram:] represents alloc of different UML Nodes, HW/SW allocation (``like component diagram in 3D'')
	\item[use-case diagram:] model interactions (include description)
\end{description}

\subsection{Interfaces and Contracts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item interfaces must be specified, s.t. other objects can be developed in parallel
	\item several interfaces per object/module possible
	\item use UML class diagrams
	\item operations A,B concurrent, if \dots A\dots B\dots and \dots B\dots A\dots is possible (logical parallelisation, execution on different hw, A/B not data-flow interdependent)
	\item use inherent concurrency to distribute system
	\item use \textbf{Activity Diagrams} to model concurrent workflows, like workflows, thick bars are sync-points, ``swim-lanes'' are separation denoting different systems \\
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/activity-diagram.png}
	\item in distributed systems: remote object invocation, middlware (hide the fact, that object is remote, CORBA, COM/DCOM, .net, Java RMi)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{CORBA} (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)
		\item object request broker \textsc{Orb} (locate object, activate object, communicate request, return reply) server/servants don't need to be objects (C,Cobol)
		\item \textbf{static} remote interface of CORBA object is known at compile time (code used to generate client stub)
		\item \textbf{dynamic} remote interface not known at compile time
		\item interface definition language \textsc{Idl}: interfaces need to be exactly specified (direct access to variables in remote classes, access only through interface, desired language-independent IDL, that compiles into access methods)
		\item \textsc{Corba Idl} interface specifies names + methods, extended use of C++ syntax
		\begin{description}
			\item[IDL modules] logical grouping of interface/type definitions, defines naming scope
			\item[IDL interface] methods that are available in CORBA objects implementing interface
			\item[IDL methods] specify signatures, parameters are labeled \texttt{in} (from client to server), \texttt{out} (from server to client) and \texttt{inout}, \texttt{oneway} (client will not be blocked on invoking), \texttt{raises} (exceptions)
			\item[IDL attributes] like public fields, may be readonly, get/put methods automatically generated
			\item[IDL interface inheritance] interface may be refinement of other interface
			\item[IDL type names generated by compilter] IDL prefix, type name, prefix number
		\end{description}
		\item CORBA object model (implements IDL interface, has remote object reference, capable of responding to remote invocations)
		\item CORBA has no objects/classes \follows use structs, classes cannot be arguments/results
		\item CORBA can be documented with UML
		\item CORBA architecture
		\begin{description}
			\item[skeltons] generated by IDL compiler, marshaling/unmarshaling of arguments/exceptions
			\item[client stub/proxy] in application language, generated by IDL interface definition, marshaling/unmarshaling of arguments/exceptions
		\end{description}
 	\end{itemize}
 	\item Design-by-Contract\texttrademark \follows Eiffel language
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item server must \emph{ensure postcondition}, can \emph{assume precondition}
 		\item client must \emph{ensure precondition}, can \emph{assume postcondition}
 		\item UML Object Constraints Language (OCL) \\
 		\input{images/UMLOCL}
 		\begin{description}
 			\item[put] precondition \texttt{!containsKey(key)}, postcondition \texttt{get(key==entry)}
 			\item[get] precondition \texttt{containsKey(key)}, postcondition \texttt{!containsKey(key))}
 			\item[remove] precondition \texttt{containsKey(key)}, postcondition \texttt{!containinsKey(key)}
 		\end{description}
 	\end{itemize}
 	\item \emph{subcontracts} (inheritance), subconstructor may
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item keep or weaken precondition (more may be let in)
 		\item keep or strengthen postcondition (less may come out)
 	\end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Dictionaries}
\begin{itemize}
	\item low level data decisions \follows late in design process
	\item representation of data structures only known to those with direct data interaction (information hiding)
	\item \textbf{Data Dictionary} list of all names, entities, realtionships, attributes used (name management, avoid duplication, store organisational knowledge)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Architecture and Patterns}
\begin{shaded}
``The \emph{architecture of a software system} defines that system in terms of computational components and interactions among thos components.'' \\
``\dots involves the description of elements from which systems are built, interactions among there elements, patterns that guide their composition, and constraints on these patterns.''
\end{shaded}

\paragraph{Architectural Styles:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item pipe and filter \\ \input{images/pipesandfilters}
	\item call and return (recommended high fan-in, low fan-out) \\ \input{images/callandreturn}
	\item layers in hirarchical architecture (layer: group of closely related and highly coherent functionalities) \\ \input{images/vertpart} \\ \input{images/horpart}
	\item opaque layering: vm can only callfrom layer below \follows separation of concerns, maintainability, flexibility
	\item transparent layering: vm can call from any layer \follows runtime efficiency (no parameter/message passing, data conversion, format changes)
	\item clients/servers (communication by recipients)
	\begin{description}
		\item[client] process wishing to access data/use resources/perform operations
		\item[server:] process managing data and shared resources
	\end{description}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design Patterns}
\begin{shaded}
``Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way, that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.'' Christopher Alexander
\end{shaded}
\begin{itemize}
	\item improved documentation, more abstract level of programming, improved communication

{\tiny part can be done automatically with e.g. JML/Javadoc}

\section{Testing and Software Quality Assurance (\textsc{Sqa})}
\begin{itemize}
	\item about 1 faults per 1000 lines of code
	\item verification and validation techniques (code analysis, review, testing, formal verification), the earlier, the better (cost)
	\begin{description}
		\item[verification] \emph{prove} that a product meets its specification (formal verification, correctness proofs)
		\item[validation] \emph{experiment} with system, to show iot meets requirements (simulating, testing, model cheking)
	\end{description}
	\item code quality assessment (software metrics)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Testing and Strategies}
\subsection{Reviews and Inspections}
\subsubsection{Reviews}
\begin{itemize}
	\item technical meetings (walk-through, inspections)
	\item objectives: software quality assurance, training
	\item non-objectives: progess review, budget, trouble-shooting, reprisals, political intrigue
	\item review leader, standards bearer (SQA), mainenance oracle (devils advocate), recorder, user representative, producer, reviewer
	\item evaluate before review
	\item review product, not producer (ask questions instead of accusing, avoid criticising style \follows technical correctness)
	\item raise issues, don't resolve them
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Code walk-through}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ``playing the computer'' \follows ``interpret code''
	\item 3-5 participants
	\item discover, don't fix errors
	\item moderator, secretary, auditors, designer (explain own design)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Code Inspections}
\begin{itemize}
	\item similar to code-walkthrough, different goal: look for commonly made mistakes, no simulation of computers behaviour
	\item unitialized variables, jumps into loops, incompatible assignements, nonterminating loops, array boundaries, storage allocation/deallocation, parameter mismatches
	\item analysis tools can be helpfull
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Coverage}
\begin{description}
	\item[white box testing] source is revealed ((code) structural testing)
	\item[black box testing] no source available (test against requirements specification)
	\item[grey box testing] some internal state variables are revealed
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Types of Testing}
\input{images/testing}
\begin{description}
	\item[unit/module Testing] check that one module meets design specifications (often during programming)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item to be tested: methods within object, classes with several attributes/methods, components consisting of multiple classes + internal interfaces
		\item it's not testing the system as a whole
		\item complete coverage: testing all operations with all possible combinations of parameters + setting and testing all possible combinations of object attribute values + testing all possible states \follows number blowup
		\item two types of tests:\\
		normal \follows unit does, what it is supposed to do \\
		robustness test \follows when subjected to ``hostile environment'' unit is robust
	\end{itemize}
	\item[integration testing] done during assembly  of complete system, test that modules work together, test that system meets requirements (done by integrators, test specialists)
	\item[system testing] testing the system as a whole
	\item[acceptance testing] test that customer performs when software is delivered (may be fixed in requirement specification or contract)
	\item[regression testing] performed during maintenance/when component has changed (ensure that what worked in the past, will work in the future)
	\item[stress testing] test system under extreme conditions
\end{description}
\subsubsection{formalized testing}
\begin{description}
	\item[$D$:] input domain
	\item[$R$:] arbitrary set, results
	\item[$P$:] patial function, describing programm input/output behaviour: $P:D\to R$
	\item[$OR$:] the output value requirements (from \textsc{Srs})
	\item[testing:]determine where for given $d\in D,P(d)$ meets requirements stated in $OR$, if \follows sucess, else fail
	\item[$d\in D$:] is test case
	\item[$T\subseteq D$:] is test set/suite
	\item[$T$:] is sucessfull, iff all $d\in T$ sucessfull
	\item[$C\subseteq 2^D_f$:]  is selection criterion, $2^D_f$ is set of all finite subsets of $D$
	\item[$T$:] satisfies $C$ iff $T\in C$
	\item[for all $i,k$:] let $T_i,T_k$ satisfy $C$, $C$ is consistent if ($T_i$ is sucessfull iff $T_k$ is sucessfull)
	\item[$C$:] is complete if, when $P$ is incorrect, there is a $T$ satisfying $C$ which is unsucessfull
	\item[if $C$ complete and consistent:] any test $T$ that satisfies $C$ decides $P$'s correctness
\end{description}

\subsubsection{selective testing - how many paths to test?}
\begin{description}
	\item[Statement Coverage] select $T$ s.t. by executing $P(d)$ for every $d\in T$, \textbf{each statement is at least executed once} {\tiny statement \follows square}
	\item[edge coverage] select $T$ s.t. \textbf{each edge in control flow graph is traversed at least once}
	\item[condition coverage] select $T$ s.t. \textbf{edge coverage is satisfied and all possible values for consituent proposition inside conditions are exercised at least once} {\tiny each check must be executed}
	\item[multiple condition coverage] each boolean combination of the consitutent predicates of every condition needs to be exercised at least once {\tiny each combination (of sucess/failure) at least once}
	\item[path coverage] select $T$ s.t. all paths from an inital ndoe to a final node in the control flow graph are traversed at least once
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Basis Path Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item assess how many tests are needed to achieve statement \& path coverage (prog is single entry, single exit, control flow graph available, all decisions binary)
	\item calculate cyclomatic complexity $V(G)$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $V(G)=$ \# of simple decissions $+1$
		\item $V(G)=$ \# of enclosed areas $+1$
	\end{itemize}
	\item loop testing ($n$ is number of allowable passes)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item skip the loop
		\item one pass
		\item two passes
		\item $m$ passes through loop, $m<n$
		\item $(n-1), n, (n+1)$ passes through the loop
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{testing based on contracts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item possible test selection criteria
	\begin{itemize}
		\item input conform with the precondition
		\item inputs with a violated precondition
		\item inputs where key element is of correct type
		\item inputs where key element is of wrong type
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Acceptance Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item demonstrate system is ready for operational use
	\item choice of tests by client, is conducted by client
	\item may be part of contract
	\item alpha test: tests in devs environment, beta test: tests in clients environment
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{integration testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item driver: component that calls the \texttt{testedUnit}, controls test cases
	\item stub: component that the \texttt{testedUnit} depends on (``fake'')
	\item big bang - just put together and see, if it works
	\item top-down - tests the top layer first, then downward \follows stubs are needed, test can be designed by the functionality of system
	\item bottom-up - subsystem in lowest layer testet first \follows drivers are needed (test ui (most important part) last)
	\item sandwich - combination of bottom-up and top-down, converges at target layer \follows does not test individual layers thouroghly
	\item modified sandwich - combination of all other tests
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Software Product Metrics}
\begin{description}
	\item[fan-in/fan-out] number of functions or methods, that call other functions or methods (X). Fan-out is the number of functions, thar are called by X. High Fan-in shows tight coupling (changes to X not good), high Fan-out suggests high complexity

	\item[Cyclomatic Complexity]
	\item[Length of Identifiers] longer identifiers are simpler to understand
	\item[depth of conditional nesting] deep nesting is hard to understand

 \end{description}

\subsubsection{Object-Oriented Software Metrics}
\begin{description}
	\item[depth of inheritance tree] deeper inheritance tree \follows more complex design
	\item[Method fan-in/fan-out] distringuish between internal (good) and external (bad) methods, see above
	\item[weighted methods per class] number of methods in a class weighted by its complexity \follows high value is bad
	\item[number of overriding operations] high value indicates, superclass not good model for subclass
